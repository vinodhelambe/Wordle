🚀 Just Launched My First Project - Wordle in C++! 🎮

Hey there! 👋 Today, I unleashed something special in code – my very first project. It's a text-based Wordle game created from scratch in C++!

🌐 Why Wordle?
Because what better way to dive into the world of coding than with a classic word-guessing game, right?

👨‍💻 Tech Stack:
C++
Windows API (for a polished console display)
Random Word API

🌟 Features I'm Excited About:

1. Random Word Generator API: Yep, that's right! I spiced things up by integrating a random word generator API for endless word possibilities.
2. Sleek Console UI: A minimalist and sleek console display for a user-friendly experience.
3. Real-time Feedback: Color-coded feedback on guessed letters to keep players engaged.
